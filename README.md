Add a touch of randomness to your daily walking routine.
This program suggests a random path of certain distance (that you select), starting from your home location and back to it.

download the script and make the necessary changes...
PLACE_NAME - the region name for which you want to download the map
START_LAT_LON - latitude and longitude of your location
TARGET_DISTANCE_KM - the distance that you want to walk
DISTANCE_TOLERANCE - the margin or error for your target distance (because it is random, finding an exact match is rare)
OUTPUT_FILENAME - the filename you want your random walk data saved into. (contains gmap link)
